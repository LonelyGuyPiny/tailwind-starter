# Instructions

## Develop locally

yarn && yarn dev

## .html files

For a one-off case, you can work directly o the index.html file. If you are developing multiple pages, use the pages/ folder and create each separate page eg. shop.html, single-product.html, etc.

## Colors 
override the default tailwind colors, in order to match the site's color palette. This will also ensure as smaller css footprint on the final build.
